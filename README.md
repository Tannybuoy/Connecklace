Travel safe while connected to your loved ones 

## Team Weirdoughs at TartanHacks

## 💡 Inspiration
The idea came when I read an article which spoke about women safety when travelling, and how 93% of them shared their itinerary with a friend or family member to feel safe. Since I have been told by my family since forever that I should share my location with them everytime I travel, I resonated with this thought. We felt there could be a way to build piece of mind for both parties involved by using IoT and ML to integrate hardware and software for this sole purpose of making the community a better place.

## ⚙ What it does
The solution proposed is a 3d printed necklace which can house sensors like temperature sensor, pulse rate sensor and led lights and a buzzer. It is currently two devices using Particle Argon's IoT abilities to interact with each other. 

## 🔧 How we built it
We had a multidisciplinary team, so we first decided what components exist in our solution. After that we split up work. One person was in charge of designing the Solidworks model and doing the 3d printing, one person was in charge of the website, one person was in charge of hardware and the fourth member used ML for temperature anomaly detection.

## 💪 Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges, some right before the submission deadline. Circuits are moody and they work sometimes and sometimes they don't. It was my first time sending data from Particle to the Google Cloud Platform for further use. 

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am super glad to be part of this amazing team and having built all the components. This was my first in-person hackathon where I got to work together and learn from other members on the team.

## 📚 What we learned
I learnt a lot about how 3d printing works.


## ⏭ What's next for sportsXchange
The next steps include the following 
- Integrating all the individual components and make them work in tandem.
